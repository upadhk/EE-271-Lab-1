# EE-271-Lab-1

Task 1 - Provide a working simulation of a 4:1 mux 
Task 2 - Demonstrate the following working circuits
            1. Circuit with an inverter connected directly to an LED controlled by a switch and KEY
            2. Adding another inverter in series with the circuit above to "cancel out" the effect of the initial invertor
            3. Circuit using a NOR gate connected to two input swithces and a single output LED
